    <h2>Purpose and Focus</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sideline Cheer:</strong> Primarily focuses on supporting school or professional sports teams by leading cheers, chants, and encouraging crowd engagement during games. Its main purpose is to boost team spirit and engage the audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive Cheer:</strong> This is an athletic performance judged on difficulty, synchronization, and execution. Teams compete in choreographed routines that combine tumbling, stunts, and dance, aiming to score high on technique and creativity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Routine and Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sideline Cheer:</strong> Routines are typically shorter and often improvised, with cheerleaders adapting to the flow of the game. Cheers and stunts are chosen to respond to in-game events and keep the crowd involved.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive Cheer:</strong> Routines are meticulously planned and practiced, often lasting around 2.5 minutes and requiring precise timing and synchronization. These routines are high-intensity and emphasize athleticism, with complex stunts and tumbling sequences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Unique Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sideline Cheer:</strong> Requires adaptability and a constant, high-energy presence for prolonged periods, often outdoors in various weather conditions. Cheerleaders need to stay engaged with the crowd and keep energy levels up throughout the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive Cheer:</strong> Demands intense physical conditioning, teamwork, and rigorous practice to execute challenging stunts under pressure. Teams face the added pressure of scoring and often deal with a strict training regimen and competition stress.</li>
    </ul>
